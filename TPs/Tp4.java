/**
    Tp4 java.util.function.* package contains 43 commonly used functional interfaces so you dont have to write a functional interface 
    on your own as we did in  Tp2.
    some of them are:
    - Consumer<T> - function that takes an argument of type T but returns void.
    - Supplier<T> - function that takes no argument and returns a result of type T.
    - Predicate<T> - function that takes an argument of type T and returns a boolean
    - Function<T,R> - function that takes an argurmet of type T and returns a result of type R.
 
    Just the equivalent of having a functional interface where one method passing and return type is like above, and we dont care about the name.
